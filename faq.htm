<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>


<h3>Q: Why?</h3>

<b>A:</b> Because.
<br><br>


<h3>Q: It's cool that you have all these scripts on the site, but what good are they to me?</h3>

<b>A:</b> I update them whenever it's brought to my attention that there was a mistake in our release. Obviously, we don't make v2s for every little mistake, but you have the opportunity to get the updated script here and mux it yourself if you want.<br>
If you don't know how, you can check <a href="../mkvtools/index.htm">this guide</a>.
<br><br>


<h3>Q: How do I use xdeltas?</h3>

<b>A:</b> <a href="xdelta.htm">Like this</a>.
<br><br>


<h3>Q: Is this the official Vivid website?</h3>

<b>A:</b> Yes. Has been all along. If you thought it wasn't, joke's on you.
<br><br>


<h3>Q: Why is your html code so atrocious? It makes me want to cry / kill myself.</h3>

<b>A:</b> Because I (unanimated) am the spawn of Satan and want to exterminate mankind with atrocious html code.<br>
I have discovered that people aren't satisfied with looking at web pages and seeing what they're supposed to see, but actually go check the code for reasons not entirely clear to me and then lament over stuff that is "broken" (even though it does exactly what it's supposed to). So it has become my plan to obliterate humanity with broken code that works.
<br><br>


<h3>Q: Why is the latest episode not released yet? Shouldn't you be done by now?</h3>

<b>A:</b> I don't know. Should we? We might be if none of us had anything else to do with our lives, but that's not the case.<br>
We sub what we want, how we want, when we want, and we have no obligation whatsoever to anyone even if some individuals with mental issues think that we owe them to do what they want or expect us to do. If you think you can do it better and faster every week, why don't you?
<br><br>


<h3>Q: Does anyone actually ask you these questions frequently, or are you just making this shit up?</h3>

<b>A:</b> Depends on which ones.
