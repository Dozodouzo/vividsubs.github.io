Affected with or subject to melancholy; 2. Of or relating to melancholia. Melancholy (adjective): 1. Feeling, showing, or expressing depression of the spirits. Sad or dejected; 2. Causing or tending to cause sadness or gloom: a letter with some melancholy news; 3. Pensive. Thoughtful.] Now, while I strongly dislike using "melancholy" as an adjective, it's clear to see from these definitions that it includes affecting melancholy in others, whereas "melancholic" does not. Since Hijiribe Ruri is a somewhat supernatural being, I did not think this causal link would be irrelevant, so I decided on the noun form of the adjective.}
