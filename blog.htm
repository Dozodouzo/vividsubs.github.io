<h3>Some Vivid Thoughts on Various Aspects of Fansubbing</h3><br>



<h4>Chicago, Webster, and Ellipses—Oh my!</h4>
<h5>2014-10-21 by Devana</h5>

Okay, so this may very well be the death of my much-loved anonymity (or at least inconspicuousness) in the fansubbing world, but... Well, unanimated suggested that I write some posts on my convoluted yet informative thoughts regarding editing, and I suddenly warmed up to the idea.<br><br>

So I'll mainly be discussing editing-oriented subjects, particularly of episodes of anime I edit or QC (which is not much, lately). Like many others, I'm vaguely aware of fansubbing drama, but just as you might do with a crazy person on the street, I try not to look it in the eye lest it direct its insanity towards me as well. So I'll just stick to writing words about words. :)<br><br>

There are also some things you, the reader, should know since I'll reference them often.<br><br>

I was/am an aspiring novel copyeditor. I therefore gravitate towards the style guide used by novel copyeditors: the Chicago Manual of Style (16th Edition). (Hey, if it's good enough for those who edit classic literature, shouldn't it be good enough for subtitles of similarly plot-driven content?) That being said, there are times to deviate from any style guide, and it's not uncommon to handle the same editing issue in multiple ways. There's almost never an absolutely "correct" way of saying something. Language, after all, is constantly evolving, and dialogue (the dominant part of subtitles) often demonstrates how dramatic that evolution can be. Furthermore, a style guide aimed at the printed word will likely fall short in relation to the on-screen word. So the CMoS certainly isn't the be-all and end-all of every matter of grammar, syntax, punctuation, or style; it's just a better option than 'going with your gut' most of the time. The way I figure it, there may not be an exactly right way of saying things, but there sure are plenty of wrong ways.<br><br>

Now, the CMoS uses Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, so I use it too, however grudgingly. I'm much more partial to the American Heritage Dictionary. (Yes, I'm American, although the Oxford English Dictionary would be my second choice.) Personally, I somewhat dislike Webster's (and you can go look up "literally" to see one of my reasons), but I concede that it's one of the largest, most inclusive dictionaries in the world. So I get it, Chicago. I'm still grudging, though.<br><br>

Aside from the CMoS and Webster's, there are some in-house subtitling rules I use as well. I'll address them as they come up, but there are two I can think of right off the bat. One is that semicolons, while extremely effective and arguably necessary in many technical or literary works, are generally eyesores in subtitles. I avoid them when I can—not quite like I avoid the Plague, but almost as much. Besides, aside from complex series, I don't think there's ever an instance in which replacing a semicolon with a period is totally incorrect.<br><br>

I feel similarly about the colon's being an eyesore, but it's sometimes far more necessary. And a vague ellipsis doesn't always cut it in those cases, you know? So the colon's a necessary evil on occasion.<br><br>

The second in-house rule is about ellipses and is so important that I'll just finish the rest of the post with it. So let's talk about ellipses, shall we?<br><br>

Relevant-to-subtitle ellipses are discussed in CMoS §13.48–56, the most notable sections being 13.53 and 13.54. Interestingly, omissions that occur after a complete thought take both a period and a three-point ellipsis, which means that you should expect four ellipsis points in such a case. Also interestingly, in manuscripts, ellipses are formatted sort of like this: "x . . . ? X" or "x. . . . X," each of which have a few nonbreaking spaces. Authors can use the single-glyph three-dot ellipsis character (i.e., "…"), but in the end, editors replace them with spaced periods.<br><br>

Now, can you imagine seeing that shit while you're watching anime? On-screen spaced periods look heinous, and the single-glyph crap isn't even existent in some dialogue fonts. Oh, and in some, it just looks like the Charlie-Brown-smile version of the underscore. So yeah, not happening.<br><br>

Look, editing the written word and editing the on-screen word both seek to achieve the same thing: to minimize the reader's distraction without compromising his or her grasp of the content. So imo, those CMoS ellipsis rules go right out the window when it comes to subtitles.<br><br>

Other punctuation books (e.g., <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> by Robert Bringhurst, <i>Punctuate It Right!</i> by Harry Shaw) have plenty of other things to say about ellipses and their spacing. Really, every possible combination of spacing has been suggested in some or other reputable source.<br><br>

So Xythar and I talked about it a while back, when I was new to fansubbing, and we agreed that the most uninvasive way to punctuate the ellipsis in subtitles is "x... X/x," regardless of whether the preceding sentence ends in a full thought or not. Personally, I tend towards making what comes after that lowercase (a continuation) if possible. But really, that tendency is a matter of personal preference. Whether you want to capitalize "come" in a line like "Please... come back," is entirely up to you, even if you decide to split it into two lines.<br><br>

Now, what about punctuation that comes after the ellipsis? Like, what do you do about question marks? I think the answer to that one comes kind of organically. Let's say your character asks a full question but sort of trails off. In that case, your ellipsis is only decorative (the trailing off), and the question mark is pretty important (the full question). But really, I'd say to stick with one or the other. Half-finished questions are generally okay with just an ellipsis, and full questions look fine with just question marks even when they trail off. There are rare exceptions, like when the innocent Ai from Kamisama no Inai Nichiyoubi trails off and seems to be asking not-quite-said-aloud questions to thin air. And really, I probably should've chosen one or the other even when I didn't. But we live and we learn, right?<br><br>

As long as my sense of grammar and language is constantly evolving, there will always be newfound errors with my old edits. And we all make mistakes of all kinds. I'm just as infallible as the next person, no matter how much I do my due diligence and study these topics. But I said I'd discuss editing and not philosophy, right? :P<br><br>

Anyway, when it comes to combining punctuation marks (not just with ellipses), I'd say it's generally best to pick the more necessary one. If you read the line with the audio/scene over and over again, and it just doesn't seem right without both punctuation marks, then go ahead and choose both. In the end, whatever is least noticeable to the viewer is what's right...<br><br>

except when we get to grammatically unacceptable things, like comma splices.<br><br>

Man, I hate comma splices.<br><br>

More on that at some other time. :)<br><br>
